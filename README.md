# Quote Generator

In order to combat burnout, I reached out to my community and requested them to share their go-to quotes or sayings for overcoming burnout or imposter syndrome. This web application incorporates all of those shared quotes from the tech community. I created this application not only to keep myself motivated but also with the intention of assisting others in their journey.
